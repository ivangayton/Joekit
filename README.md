Joekit
======

Joekit is an offline Java utility to convert spreadsheets, line lists, and tally sheets to KML maps.

It's a pretty clunky bit of software, and a lot of people will be better served by an online converter or a proper GIS program such as the excellent QGIS (qgis.org).  However, if you:

 * Need to convert a spreadsheet to kml, particularly if your spreadsheet doesn't have coordinates in it and you need to use a separate map (gazetteer) to link to your place-names,
 * Don't have a good internet connection
 * Have a file with information you don't want to upload to the internet (such as patient data for a medical program)

then Joekit might be useful.  

As of November 2015 I'm reactivating a bit of clean-up development on Joekit as a result of a bit of demand from field users, but eventually I want to port this to a QGIS plugin.
